When working with TypeScript, getting data into the bounds of the type system (i.e., from the aforementioned APIs) can lead to run-time errors that can be hard to find and debug. io-ts bridges the gap between compile-time type checking and run-time consumption of external data by providing encode and decode functions. Given the experiences of our teams and the elegance of its approach, we think io-ts is worth adopting.</p>"

Aleph.js,Assess,Dependencies,TRUE,"<p>There is certainly no shortage of frameworks to build web applications in JavaScript/<a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/typescript"">TypeScript</a>. We've featured many of them in the Radar, but what sets <strong><a href=""https://alephjs.org/docs"">Aleph.js</a></strong> apart in this crowded field is that it's built to run on <a href=""/radar/platforms/deno"">Deno</a>, the new server-side run time created by the original developer of <a href=""/radar/platforms/node-js"">Node</a>. This puts Aleph.js on a modern foundation that addresses several shortcomings and problems with Node. Aleph.js is still new — it’s approaching the 1.0 release at the time of writing — but it already offers a solid developer experience, including hot module replacement. With Deno now way past its <a href=""https://deno.com/blog/v1"">1.0 release</a>, this is a modern choice for projects that can take the risk.</p>"
Astro,Assess,Dependencies,TRUE,"<p>It's hard to believe, but in 2022, the developer community continues to pump out interesting new frameworks for building web applications. <strong><a href=""https://astro.build/"">Astro</a></strong> is a recent, open-source, multi-page application framework that renders HTML on the server and minimizes the amount of JavaScript sent over the wire. Astro seems particularly well-suited to content-oriented websites that pull from many different sources. We like the fact that although Astro encourages sending only HTML, it still supports — when appropriate — select active components written in the front-end JavaScript framework of your choice. It does this through its <a href=""https://mainawycliffe.dev/blog/island-architecture/"">island architecture</a>. Islands are regions of interactivity within a single page where the necessary JavaScript is downloaded only when needed.

Svelte,Assess,Dependencies,FALSE,"<p>Among web component frameworks, <strong><a href=""https://svelte.dev/"">Svelte</a></strong> stands out by moving reactivity out of the browser and into the compiler. Instead of optimizing DOM updates by using a virtual DOM and browser optimization tricks, Svelte compiles your code into vanilla framework-less JavaScript code that surgically updates the DOM directly. In addition to the run-time performance benefits, this also allows Svelte to optimize the amount of code the browser has to download without sacrificing features for developers; moreover, it's proven to be performant and battery-friendly for mobile web applications as less code has to execute in the browser itself. Performance benefits aside, our teams have appreciated its friendly learning curve and the maintenance benefits that come from <a href=""https://svelte.dev/blog/write-less-code"">writing less code</a>.

Fetching, caching, synchronizing and updating server state is a common requirement in many React applications, and although the requirements are well understood, getting the implementation right is notoriously difficult. React Query provides a straightforward solution using hooks. It works hand-in-hand with existing async data-fetching libraries like <a href=""/radar/tools/axios"">axios</a>, <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/fetch"">Fetch</a> and <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/graphql"">GraphQL</a> since they are built on promises.

We like that it works out of the box but still offers a lot of configuration when needed. The developer tools, unfortunately not yet available for <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/react-native"">React Native</a>, also help developers new to the framework understand how it works. For React Native, you can use a <a href=""https://github.com/bgaleotti/react-query-native-devtools"">third-party developer tools plugin</a> utilizing <a href=""/radar/tools/flipper"">Flipper</a>.

When in the Kubernetes space, we also use <a href=""https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl"">nerdctl</a>, a Docker-compatible CLI for containerd. Since Kubernetes has deprecated Docker as container run time and most managed-services (EKS, GKE, etc) are following its lead, more people will be looking to containerd native tools, hence the importance of tools like nerdctl.

Team cognitive load,Adopt,Techniques,TRUE,"<p>Team interaction is a key concept when redesigning an organization for business agility and speed.

Our advice is to be intentional about how teams are designed and how they interact. Because we believe that organizational design and team interactions evolve over time, we think it's particularly important to measure and keep track of the <strong>team cognitive load</strong>, which indicates how easy or difficult teams find building, testing and maintaining their services.

git-together,Assess,Techniques,TRUE,"<p>We're always looking for ways to remove small frictions from pair programming, which is why we're excited by <a href=""https://github.com/kejadlen/git-together""><strong>git-together</strong></a>, a tool written in Rust that simplifies git commit attribution during pairing. By aliasing <code>git-together</code> as <code>git</code>, the tool allows you to add extensions to <code>git config</code> that capture committer information, aliasing each committer by their initials. Changing pairs (or switching to soloing or mob programming) requires you to run <code>git with</code>, followed by the initials of the pair (for example: <code>git with bb cc</code>), allowing you to resume your regular git workflow afterward. Every time you commit, git-together will rotate through the pair as the official author that git stores, and it will automatically add any other authors to the bottom of the commit message. The configuration can be checked in with the repo, allowing git-together to work automatically after cloning a repo.</p>"
SLIs and SLOs as code,Assess,Techniques,TRUE,"<p>Since Google first popularized service-level indicators (SLIs) and service-level objectives (SLOs) as part of their site reliability engineering (SRE) practice, observability tools like <a href=""https://docs.datadoghq.com/monitors/service_level_objectives/"">Datadog</a>, <a href=""https://www.honeycomb.io/slos"">Honeycomb</a> and <a href=""https://www.dynatrace.com/news/blog/what-are-slos/"">Dynatrace</a> started incorporating SLO monitoring into their toolchains. <a href=""https://github.com/OpenSLO/OpenSLO"">OpenSLO</a> is an emerging standard that allows defining <strong>SLIs and SLOs as code</strong>, using a declarative, vendor-neutral specification language based on the YAML format used by <a href=""/radar/platforms/kubernetes"">Kubernetes</a>.

Local-first application,Assess,Techniques,TRUE,"<p>In a centralized application, the data on the server is the single source of truth ‚Äî any modification to the data must go through the server.

CUPID,Assess,Techniques,TRUE,"<p>How do you approach writing good code? How do you judge if you've written good code?

Traditionally, metrics are defined inside the context of BI tools, but this approach leads to duplication and inconsistencies as different teams use them in different contexts. By decoupling the definition in the metrics store, we get clear and consistent reuse across BI reports, visualizations and even embedded analytics. This technique is not new; for example, Airbnb introduced <a href=""https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/airbnb-metric-computation-with-minerva-part-2-9afe6695b486"">Minerva</a> a year ago. However, we're now seeing considerable traction in the data and analytics ecosystem with more tools supporting metrics stores out of the box.</p>"
Path-to-production mapping,Assess,Techniques,TRUE,"<p>Although <strong>path-to-production mapping</strong> has been a near-universal practice at Thoughtworks since codifying <em><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Continuous-Delivery-Deployment-Automation-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321601912"">Continuous Delivery</a></em>, we often come across organizations unfamiliar with the practice. The activity is most often done in a workshop with a cross-functional group of people ‚Äî  that includes everyone involved in designing, developing, releasing and operating the software ‚Äî around a shared whiteboard (or virtual equivalent). First, the steps in the process are listed in order, from the developer workstation all the way to production. Then, a facilitated session is used to capture further information and pain points. The most common technique we see is based on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-stream_mapping"">value-stream mapping</a>, although plenty of <a href=""https://caroli.org/en/path-to-production/"">process map</a> variants are equally valuable.

Accessibility annotations in designs,Assess,Techniques,TRUE,"<p>The earlier accessibility is considered in software delivery, the easier and cheaper it is to ensure what's built works for as many people as possible. Tools that help communicate <strong>accessibility annotations in designs</strong> help teams consider important elements like document structure, semantic HTML and alternative texts from the beginning of their work. This enables them to ensure user interfaces meet global accessibility standards and address common failures that are actually fairly easy to avoid. <a href=""/radar/tools/figma"">Figma</a> offers a range of accessibility notation plugins: <a href=""https://www.figma.com/community/file/953682768192596304"">The A11y Annotation Kit</a>, Twitter's <a href=""https://www.figma.com/community/file/976946194228458698"">Accessibility Annotation Library</a> and the Axe toolset's <a href=""https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1085612091163821851/Axe-for-Designers-(FREE)"">Axe for Designers</a>.</p>"

Planning for full utilization,Hold,Techniques,TRUE,"<p>While the practice of creating excess capacity in the delivery process is well-known in the <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Product-Development-Flow-Generation/dp/1935401009"">product management community</a>, we still see far too many teams <strong>planning for full utilization</strong> of team members. Reserving some capacity during sprint planning generally leads to better predictability <em>and</em> better quality; it promotes team resilience to unexpected events like illnesses, production issues, unexpected product requests and tech debt, while also allowing productive activities like team building and ideation that can lead to product innovation. Running at less than full utilization means teams can be more thoughtful about the robustness of the resulting software and pay closer attention to the right observability signals. Our experience is that a fully utilized team leads to a collapse in throughput as well, just as a fully utilized highway creates slow and demoralizing traffic. For example, when one of our teams had unpredictable support issues, they saw a 25% increase in throughput and a 50% decrease in cycle time volatility by planning feature velocity based on only two of the three developer pairs' capacities.</p>"
Incremental developer platform,Trial,Techniques,TRUE,"<p>We've been writing about developer platforms and how to build them in almost every edition of the Radar since 2017. In the meantime, the <em><a href=""https://teamtopologies.com/book"">Team Topologies</a></em> book has also done a great job of describing the ideal of a platform that supports developers with ""self-service APIs, tools, services and knowledge."" However, we often see teams shooting for too much of that platform vision too fast. Instead, building an <strong>incremental developer platform</strong> is key.</p>

<p><em>Team Topologies</em> recommends to always strive for what they call the ""Thinnest Viable Platform"" necessary at any given stage, where the first version could even be just a set of documentation on a wiki. The next increment could increase the service level by providing templates or allowing teams to create pull requests. Further increments could then introduce self-service APIs, but only if valuable. In short, even though we've cautioned against fully <a href=""/radar/techniques/ticket-driven-platform-operating-models"">ticket-driven platform operating models</a>, going from zero to self-service is the other extreme.

Software Bill of Materials,Trial,Techniques,FALSE,"<p>With continued pressure to keep systems secure and no reduction in the general threat landscape, a machine-readable <strong>Software Bill of Materials</strong> (SBOM) may help teams stay on top of security problems in the libraries that they rely on. Since the original <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/"">Executive Order</a> was published, the industry has gained clarity and understanding of what an SBOM is and how to create one; the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), for example, now has more <a href=""https://www.nist.gov/itl/executive-order-14028-improving-nations-cybersecurity/software-security-supply-chains-software-1"">specific advice</a> on how to comply with the order.

GitHub Copilot,Assess,Tools,TRUE,"<p><strong><a href=""https://github.com/features/copilot"">GitHub Copilot</a></strong> is an AI coding assistant, created by a collaboration between Microsoft and OpenAI. It uses machine learning models to generate suggestions based on the context of what a developer is working on. It features strong IDE integration and uses an existing codebase and editor context to create suggestions. Despite being billed as ""your AI pair programmer"" we would not call what it does ""pairing"" — we'd probably describe it as a kind of supercharged, context-sensitive Stack Overflow. When it correctly predicts what a developer is trying to do, it can be a powerful tool for getting stuff done. Like all LLM-based AIs, though, it has a tendency to hallucinate the use of plausible but nonexistent APIs and may introduce bugs through slightly faulty algorithms. We've had success generating code at the line, block and method level, as well as creating tests or infrastructure configurations. Interestingly, it works best when you use good naming practices, so it encourages more readable code.</p>

<p>AI tool capabilities are advancing rapidly, and we think it's sensible for organizations to try them. Some sales pitches for Copilot have claimed very high efficiency gains, but we remain skeptical: after all, writing code isn't the only thing that developers spend time on, and it's notoriously difficult to measure developer productivity in the first place. That said, Copilot is a fairly inexpensive tool; if it offers any productivity gain at all, it's probably worth it. <a href=""https://github.com/features/preview/copilot-x"">Copilot X</a> — in preview as of this writing — offers additional functionality and integration within a software creation workflow. Copilot has a <a href=""https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/overview-of-github-copilot/about-github-copilot-for-business"">""for business""</a> offering, which provides more clarity around intellectual property issues as well as the ability to manage tool features centrally across an organization.

Obsidian,Assess,Tools,TRUE,"<p>Knowledge management is critical for tech workers, as we need to be constantly learning and staying up to date with the latest technology developments. Recently, tools such as <strong><a href=""https://obsidian.md/"">Obsidian</a></strong> and <a href=""https://logseq.com/"">Logseq</a> have emerged in the category of note-taking tools that support linking notes to form a knowledge graph, while storing them in plain markdown files in a local directory, thus letting users own their data.
